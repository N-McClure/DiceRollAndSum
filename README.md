# DiceRollAndSum
This is my first application that I built using Angular and TypeScript.
It was for my Mobile-Web Development class.

I have never touched or used Angular or TS before this.

Please Ignore the lack of CSS and Styling...we were instructed to just focus on functionality.

This project is missing the .Angular folder because it is Gigantic and I was instructed not to include it.
